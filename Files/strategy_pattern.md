## Strategy pattern 

*Take what varies and "encapsulate" it so it won't affect the rest of your code.* 

> **The strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms,encapsulates each one, and makes theme interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


Remenber, knowing concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and ploymorphism do not make you a good object oriented designer. A design guru think about how to create flexible designs that are maintainable and that can cope with change.


### Bullet points

* Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good OO designer.

* Good OO designs are reusable, extensible and maintainable.

* Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.

* Patterns are proven object-oriented experience.

* Patterns don't give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific application.

* Patterns aren't invented, they are discoverd.

* Most patterns and principles address issues of change in software.

* Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.

* We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.

* Pattern provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.
